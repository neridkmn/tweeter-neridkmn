# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a single-page Twitter clone, where users can create short posts of up to 140 characters and have them appended to the main page. Posts are sequential, with the most recent posts appearing at the top of the page. To do so, Tweeter fetches a list of posts from a simplified ‘server’ and allows users to add posts to this list dynamically. All the requests will be made asynchronously, which will allow us to gain familiarity using the jQuery library to make these requests.

This project contains HTML & CSS code to apply techniques of responsive web design, including media queries, flexbox and Client Side JavaScript and alongside; 

* Using jQuery to bind event handlers and to create and manipulate DOM elements, 
* AJAX to send and fetch information from a server and display it on the web page, 
* jQuery to make AJAX requests to send and fetch data from a server and dynamically display it on the web page, and
* JavaScript to validate form data and display error messages.
